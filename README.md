### Idea of this project: 
What is a subsistence cost diet?

What kinds of populations might this be relevant for?
    - country going through famine
    - country going through some natural disaster
      - need to fly in relief
      - money, time, how to cover a starving population... 
    - isolated areas, like rural areas
    - refugees, refugee camps 
    - prisons: making sure prisoners are adequately nourished but minimize cost 
    - food deserts?
