## Planning, February 20: 

Things we need to do before we can do any analysis: 
- Build the diet (pick what foods to compare prices for)
- Actually record the prices for these foods in each area we're looking at (Safeway prices)

Then: 
- Create the initial [A] deliverable function that returns the diet (from the notebook \textittt{diet_problem})
- Then use the linear program to get more accurate and broader inference using the notebook \textittt{diet_problem2})
